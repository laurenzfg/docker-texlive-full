[![Docker Stars](https://github.com/laurenzfg/docker-texlive-full/actions/workflows/publish-docker-image/badge.svg)](https://github.com/laurenzfg/docker-texlive-full/pkgs/container/docker-texlive-full)

This is a Docker image containing a [`TeX Live`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX_Live) installation with many required packages, several fonts, German language support
and other stuff (like GNU `make` or, Python with some data science packages) I need in my TeX workflow.
The goal is to provide a full `Tex Live` installation with all tools and fonts required to do stuff.
